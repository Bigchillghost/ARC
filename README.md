# Introduction
Animation Recipe Cracker, abbreviated as ARC, is a helper tool aimed for quick research and examination on animation data. It provides a text-based C-like layout definition interface with dozens of pre-defined variables, along with other commands for custom variable definition, allowing to de-serialize different animation formats in a concise yet flexible way. There're also plenty of useful GUI options for interpreting the read data.
